                <h3>What is Socrates?</h3>
                <p>Socrates is a platform that enables easier question and answer sessions in any setting. By allowing a user
                    to remain anonymous when asking their question, it eliminates the opportunity for judgement -- which
                    means more authentic questions. With the upvoting feature, other audience members can vote for questions
                    they agree with to allow the host to see the most popular questions all in real time and all while never
                    requiring the user to speak out.</p>

                    <h3>Increase Audience Engagement</h3>
                    <p>Eliminate the fear of judgement by allowing people to ask their questions anonymously. With our real-time
                        sync across all devices, users will see each question asked immediately. Using the upvote functionality,
                        the most popular questions will rise to the top, so if there is limited time the most popular questions
                        are sure to get an answer.

                    <h3>Save Time</h3>
                    <p>No one wants to hear a novel when you're attending a limited-time Q&A session. Everyone knows at least
                        one conference or speech they have been to where the microphone was handed to someone, and they spent
                        twenty minutes telling a story just to ask a five second question. With Socrates as your question
                        and answer platform, you ensure you have enough time to answer the most popular questions that the
                        entire audience wants answered.
