# Socrates

Socrates is an idea that was born from the minds of inquisitive students. I'm sure you've been in, or at least seen, a modern day classroom. Every class has at least ONE person that is afraid to ask questions due to the fear of looking stupid or being judged by their peers. Socrates is here to change that.

## Anonymous Question and Answer

Socrates wants to enable the user to quickly and easily answer questions that all of their peers can see in real time. The user's peers can upvote questions they agree with or want to know about, allowing the teacher to immediately address the biggest knowledge gaps in the room -- all thanks to real-time functionality provided by Firebase.

## Other Applications

Socrates could be used as a Q&A app at big conferences as well. If you've ever been to a conference, you know that Q&A sessions are normally taken up with "Thanks so much for being here..." "I'm so honored to talk to you..." Newsflash people: The audience isn't here to see you. They're in attendance for whoever you're posing the question to! Let Socrates be the mediator for questions. An audience can vote on their favorite questions in real time and the speaker and their team can moderate the questions as they come in, making sure the most popular questions get answers.
